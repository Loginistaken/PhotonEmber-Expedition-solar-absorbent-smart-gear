🚀 PROMOTIONAL 

Introducing the Ultimate Bio-Hybrid Solar Cooling Vest

Stay cool in the heat, sustainably and independently—whether at work, on the trail, or on the job:

    Triple-mode cooling power:

        Phase‑Change Material (PCM): plant-based packs (18–22 °C) that absorb body heat passively for hours.

        Thermoelectric (Peltier) active cooling: solar-powered modules draw heat away via heat sinks and fans.

        Water-flow system: micro-pump circulates chilled water around the torso for targeted comfort.

    Solar independence: Built-in flexible solar cells (6–8 W total) and battery support 5–12 V cooling systems—no outlet required.

    Eco-first design: Hemp‑cotton outer shell, moisture-wicking mesh interior, non-toxic biodegradable PCM, and modular, repairable components.

    User-focused versatility:

        Ideal for outdoor workers, athletes, peace makers, hikers, medical users with heat sensitivity.

        Flexible PCM pouches let you switch between passive, active, or hybrid cooling.

        Optional ESP32/Nano-automated temperature control with toggle switches and safety cutoffs.

    Proven value: Constructable at $120–145 in parts—with cost-effective BOM yet high-tech capability.

Get ready to redefine wearable cooling—efficient, sustainable, adaptable. Beat the heat anywhere, anytime.
