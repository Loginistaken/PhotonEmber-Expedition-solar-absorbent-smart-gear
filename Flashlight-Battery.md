🔋 1. VoltWeave™ Dual 9V Battery Module
+ Snap-On Battery Light Add-On


🔧 Battery Module Overview
jacket uses two removable LiFePO₄ (Lithium Iron Phosphate) 
9V batteries with built-in surge protection and smart thermal insulation.


🧪 Battery Specs:

    Type: 9V DC / 2,000 mAh LiFePO₄

    Size: ~65mm (H) x 48mm (W) x 24mm (D)

    Weight: ~110g each

    Casing: Injection-molded polycarbonate with silicone weather gasket

    Features:

        Magnet-lock base plate (for jacket mount or modular devices)

        IP67+ rated port seals

        Smart controller chip (with auto-balance & thermal cutoffs)

        Ceramic + graphene PCM insulation layer

💡 Snap-On Flashlight Add-On (Battery Cap Light)


🔩 How It Works:
A modular flashlight attachment snaps directly over the battery top (similar to a battery cap), drawing regulated 9V power when toggled on.
