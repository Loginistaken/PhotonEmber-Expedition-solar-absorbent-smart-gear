🔥 Introducing the Bio-friendly Coolant freezable and washable Vest™ — Summer's Most Advanced Defense Against Heat

    "Engineered for heatwaves. Designed for humanity."

🧊 THE NEXT EVOLUTION IN SUMMER WEAR

When the summer heat becomes relentless and extreme temperatures threaten your comfort, performance, or safety — you don’t need a fan or tech. You need real, wearable cooling.
That’s why we’ve created the Bio-Frozen Cooling Vest™, a short-sleeve, reusable vest engineered with a unique double-layer cooling system that keeps your body cool for hours — without batteries, wires, or chemical packs.

This is more than a shirt.
It’s revolutionary passive climate control, redefined for today’s world.
☀️ DESIGNED FOR SUMMER

    Short-sleeve design — Allows total freedom of movement and airflow

    Lightweight but padded — Made for everyday wear, even during high heat

    Streamlined fit — Can be worn as a top layer or under light outerwear

Whether you're commuting, working outdoors, walking the dog, or navigating heat-ridden cities, this vest becomes your personal microclimate.
🌱 HOW IT WORKS

The secret lies between the layers.
🧪 A Plant-Based, Bio-Friendly Cooling Core

Inside the vest is a grid of natural, biodegradable cooling gel, made from:

    🌿 Glycerin + Aloe Vera — Locks in cold for extended periods

    🌿 Seaweed-based hydrogel (alginate) — Forms a flexible, leak-resistant matrix

    ❄️ Salt + Water blend — Freezes fast and melts slowly for gradual release

This cooling gel is sealed within soft, flexible TPU mesh compartments, sewn directly between the outer and inner layers. It forms a quilted cooling panel that wraps your torso and shoulders in uniform, lasting relief.
🧵 Multi-Layer Protection: Keeps You Cool — Not Cold

    Outer Layer: Hemp or waxed linen shell blocks sun and insulates against outside heat

    Cooling Core: Grid of bio-gel compartments stays flexible even when frozen

    Inner Layer (Redesigned for Comfort):

        🩶 Organic cotton batting for soft padding and freeze-protection

        🛡️ TPU/Eco-PUL film to block moisture from reaching your skin

        🩵 Tencel/Bamboo jersey lining to provide natural skin-cooling comfort

This unique combo means the vest stays cool but never damp, and chilled but never harsh against your skin.
🧊 HOW TO USE

Using the Bio-Frozen Cooling Vest™ is simple:

    Unzip the cooling panel from the vest lining

    Place it in your freezer (standard home freezer)

    Wait 2–4 hours (depending on freezer power)

    Zip it back in and wear it — it activates instantly

❄️ Cooling Duration:

    4 to 8 hours of active cooling, depending on ambient temperature, activity level, and humidity.

When the gel thaws, simply freeze it again and repeat.
💧 REUSABLE, WASHABLE, DURABLE

    Machine washable: Remove the inner cooling layer, then wash vest normally

    Built to last: Gel compartments are sealed with flexible seams, resisting breakage or leaks

    Non-toxic: If compromised, the gel is safe to touch and biodegradable

    Odor-resistant & anti-bacterial: Bamboo and Tencel layers reduce sweat buildup and irritation

🔁 LONGEVITY & MAINTENANCE
💡 Average Lifespan:

    With regular weekly use and proper care, your cooling vest is designed to last 12 to 18 months before any component needs replacement.

🔄 Replaceable Core:

    Cooling panel modules can be refilled or replaced without tossing the entire shirt

    Future expansion kits may include modular core refills or upgraded inserts for extreme climates

## 😌 WEAR EXPERIENCE

- **Will you feel frozen material?**  

  - No. The cotton-padded and membrane sandwich design buffers the cooling, so skin feels cool and fresh—not uncomfortably cold or "frozen."

   - Comfort is prioritized; the inner layer is soft, flexible, and breathable.

- **Will it stay cool for hours?**  

  - Yes. The bio-gel grid maintains cold for 4–8 hours, with even distribution and minimal condensation.

Outer Shell

    Hemp canvas or waxed linen: typically $10–$20/yard for quality natural fiber fabric
    Reddit+2Reddit+2Szoneier Fabrics+2

    Vest uses ~1 yard per unit → $12 (mid-range)

Inner Layers
Organic Cotton Batting

    Quilted cotton batting (~natural cotton): ~$9–13/yard
    Reddit
    Reddit

    Uses ~0.5 yard → $6

TPU / Eco‑PUL Membrane

    Laminated cotton‑TPU fabrics from suppliers range from $3–$5 per meter (~1.1 yd) for thin TPU films laminated to cotton backing
    Reddit+3Amazon+3DIY Packraft+3

    Estimate ~1 m → $4

Skin‑Layer Lining (Tencel or Bamboo Jersey)

    Rayon‑blend or Tencel knits run ~$8–18/yard
    Reddit
    Wikipedia+12Reddit+12Reddit+12

    Uses ~1 yard → $12

Cooling Core Materials

    Bio‑gel ingredients (glycerin, alginate, aloe, salt): med‑bulk cost nominal (~$1 total per vest)

    TPU mesh compartments / film packaging: similar to membrane cost ~$3

Trims & Notions

    Zippers, thread, labels, minor trims: $4–6

Total Estimated Material Cost per Vest:
$12 (outer) + $6 (batting) + $4 (membrane) + $12 (lining) + $1 (gel) + $3 (gel compartment) + $5 (notions) ≈ $43
🏭 2. Manufacturing & Labor

For specialized garment construction (quilting gel compartments, lamination, double-layer stitching):

    Small-batch / boutique factory labor: $8–12 per vest

    Larger scale foreign (e.g. Chinese) production: could be as low as $5–8
    Reddit+3Reddit+3Wikipedia+3
    Reddit

Assume mid-range labor cost: $8
🚢 3. Overhead, Packaging, & Profit Margin

    Overhead (quality control, packaging, shipping prep, sample amortization): 20% of COGS ($10)

    Desired markup for wholesale or direct sale: typically 2–3× manufacturing cost

🔢 4. Total Cost & Retail Estimate
Cost Item	Amount (USD)
Materials	$43
Labor / Manufacturing	$8
Overhead / Packaging	$10
Total Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)	$61

    Wholesale Price Estimate (2× COGS): ~$120

    Retail Price Estimate (2× wholesale): ~$240

Comparable PCM vest wholesale pricing ranges from $20–60 with minimal tech, retail $50–150

Your vest’s retail price is higher but justified by eco materials, integrated cooling layers, and garment sophistication.
🛠️ 5. Longevity and Replacement Needs

    Materials lifespan:

        TPU film composite nylon typically lasts 5–8 years in rugged gear applications
        Reddit+5ActiveMSers+5cnbaixing.com+5

        Cotton batting and Tencel lining may fade or pill after ~50 machine washes

    Cooling gel pack durability:

        Sealed TPU cells should last 12–18 months of freeze-thaw use before potential minor leaks. Replaceable core design means only gel module needs replacing.

Estimated useful life:

    Overall vest shell (fabric + seams): ~3–5 years with proper care

    Cooling core module: replace every 12–18 months

    Wash cycles: Inner/vest garment safe for machine wash after core removal; replace if lining degrades after ~50–60 cycles

⚙️ 6. Scale Considerations

    Small-run prototyping (≤200 units): per-unit costs likely ~25–30% higher due to smaller scale inefficiencies
    Reddit

    Bulk production (≥1000 units): cost reductions in material and labor, possible 15–20% lower overall per unit

✅ Summary

    Total cost to make one vest (small/medium volume): ~$60–70

    Wholesale pricing suggestion: ~$120

    Retail price estimate: $200–250

    Core replacement: every 1–1.5 years

    Vest shell lifespan: 3–5 years with washing
